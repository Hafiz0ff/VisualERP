## Phase Notes

### Phase 0 - Project Foundation

Status: completed on 2026-06-25.

Scope:
- repository structure;
- product and business context;
- architecture direction;
- engineering rules;
- AI-agent instructions;
- roadmap and ADR baseline.

Exit criteria:
- all required documentation files exist;
- docs describe a universal mini-ERP, not a single-industry tool;
- no backend or schema implementation was added.

---

### Phase 1 - Domain Model

Status: completed on 2026-06-25.

Scope:
- Finalized ubiquitous language and universal domain entities.
- Refined conceptual entity relationships, properties, and enums.
- Specified document lifecycle states, shipment-specific `SHIPPED` status, and dynamic balance derivation rules from stock movements.
- Updated API drafts, security guidelines, and developer guidelines.

Exit criteria:
- No backend code, migrations, or database schemas created.
- Detailed domain model documented in `docs/architecture/DATA-MODEL.md`.
- All operational modules, business processes, security matrices, and API specifications updated.

---

### Phase 2 - Database Schema

Status: completed on 2026-06-25.

Scope:
- Designed modular relational database schema in `prisma/schema.prisma` mapping all 30+ domain models.
- Set up UUID keys, explicit relations, timestamps, enums, indices, and organization tenant isolation.
- Created minimal idempotent demo seed data in `prisma/seed.ts` for the `dry_mixes` profile without hardcoding the core schema to one industry.
- Initialized typescript tooling (`tsconfig.json`, `package.json`) and exports (`src/db/prisma.ts`).
- Created `docs/architecture/DATABASE-SCHEMA.md` explaining database mappings and stock ledger rules.

Exit criteria:
- Prisma schema file compiles and validates successfully.
- Seed data contains correct items, units, locations, and formula BOM.
- No REST controller endpoints or UI widgets implemented.

---

### Phase 3 - API Contract

Status: completed on 2026-06-25.

Scope:
- Designed standard success, paginated list, and error JSON envelopes.
- Created `docs/architecture/API-CONTRACT.md` detailing HTTP verbs, query filters, idempotency keys, and conceptual DTO fields for all 23 groups.
- Standardized 16 error codes, HTTP statuses, and example bodies in `docs/architecture/API-ERRORS.md`.
- Mapped module permissions and role matrices in `docs/architecture/API-PERMISSIONS.md`.
- Aligned developer guidelines and testing strategies with API rules.

Exit criteria:
- No routing logic or TypeScript controller classes implemented.
- No database migrations or schema adjustments introduced.

---

### Phase 4 - Backend MVP

Status: next recommended task.

Planned outcomes:
- Initialize HTTP backend framework (Express/Next.js).
- Implement auth middlewares and tenant context scoping checks.
- Set up Zod input validator middleware and error handling transforms.
- Connect Prisma and apply migrations to a live PostgreSQL container to test `prisma/seed.ts`.
- Write core route controllers for Items, Stock Balances, and Receipts.

---

### Later Phases

Each later phase should begin only after the prior phase is documented, reviewed, and reflected in [docs/STATUS.md](docs/STATUS.md).
